    "# Finding Complicated Patterns\n",

    "In this lesson, we will learn how to use the remaining metacharacters in our list, namely:\n",

    "### Finding Names\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, our `sample_text` consists of a multi-line string that contains the names and heights of the 4 highest mountains in the world according to Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mt Everest: Height 8,848 m\n",
    "Mt. K2: Height 8,611 m\n",
    "Mt Kangchenjunga: Height 8,586 m\n",
    "Mt. Lhotse: Height 8,516 m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a regular expression that will allow us to find the names of these mountains. The first thing to notice is that the word mountain has been abbreviated in two different ways, as `Mt.` and as `Mt` (without the period). Therefore, if we want to find all the names of the mountains we need to indicate in our regular expression that the period (`.`) in the abbreviation is optional. We can do this by using the `?` metacharacter in our regular expression. The `?` will match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For example, the regular expression `ab?` will match either `a` or `ab`. In other words, the `?` after the `b` indicates that the `b` after the `a` is optional. Let’s see how this works.\n",

    "\n",
    "After that white space, we have the name of mountain. We can see that the first letter in all the names is an uppercase letter, so we will use the character set `[A-Z]` to match any possible uppercase letter.\n",

    "Now comes the tricky part. We can see that the mountain names have different lengths. For example, the third mountain has a long name,  `Kangchenjunga`, but the second mountain has a very short name, `K2`. We can get around this problem by noticing that all the names are composed of only alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match any alphanumeric character we will use the special sequence `\\w`, and to help us match names of any length we will use the `*` metacharacter. The `*` metacharacter, matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression. In other words, it matches 0 or as many repetitions as possible of the preceding regular expression. For example, the regular expression `ab*` will match `a` or `a` followed by any number of `b`'s, such as `ab` or `abbbbb`. Let's see how this works.\n",

    "To be able to match `Mnt` as well as `Mt` or `Mt.`, we will use the `( )` metacharacters to define a **Group**. As their name suggests, **groups**, group together the expressions contained inside of them. For example, we saw before that `ab*` will match `a` or `a` followed by any number of `b`'s, such as `ab` or `abbbbb`. But, if you put `ab` inside a parenthesis to define the **group** `(ab)`, then `(ab)*` will match zero or more repetitions of `ab`, for example `ab` or `abababab`. You can repeat the contents of a group with any repeating qualifier, such as `*, ?, or {m}` that we have seen before. We can also use the OR `|` metacharacter within the group to be able to select between two expressions. Let’s see how this works.\n",
